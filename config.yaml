      I am a cybersecurity professional in the military. I have a background in Electrical Engineering and worked in the military as an engineer since 2011. In 2020, I transited to another role in the cyber security domain. As an experienced manager, I love building my team, supporting their growth and helping them to deepen their technical competency. I am also very interested in using technology to "outsource" tasks so that we are able to do more productive things.

      I am currently pursuing AI topics as a hobby and am using AI to level up my knowledge in multiple fields.
